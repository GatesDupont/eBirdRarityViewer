# eBird Rarity Viewer
An intuitive shiny app that shows rare bird observations reported to eBird. You can see the application at http://www.gatesdupont.com/erv

## Full Description
This is an application I made that displays recent notable sightings from eBird in a specified region and time-frame. The user interface is very intuitive, so have fun playing around with it!

Hovering over a point reveals the species, date, and location, while clicking a point reveals a clickable link to the eBird checklist. Zoom in to see multiple species at a single location, as points are jittered. See the buttons for further specification, and the legend for color coding. Region codes can be found in the URL of an Explore Region call in eBird:
